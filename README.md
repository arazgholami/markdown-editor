# WYSIWYG Markdown Editor

A professional, lightweight, and real-time WYSIWYG Markdown editor offering robust Markdown-to-HTML conversion and excellent LTR/RTL language support.

## Overview

This editor provides a seamless experience for writing Markdown content by rendering it live in a user-friendly WYSIWYG interface. It aims to simplify Markdown editing without sacrificing the power and portability of Markdown. Key benefits include:

*   **Live Preview:** See your formatted text as you type.
*   **Intuitive Editing:** Behaves like a standard rich text editor.
*   **Robust Conversion:** Powered by `marked` for Markdown-to-HTML and `Turndown` for HTML-to-Markdown, ensuring accurate transformations.
*   **Bidirectional Text Support:** Excellent LTR/RTL handling thanks to `dir="auto"` on block elements, making it ideal for multilingual content.
*   **Lightweight & Simple:** Easy to integrate and use.

## Getting Started

### Integration

1.  **Include the script:**
    Make sure `wysiwyg-markdown-editor.bundle.js` (generated by Webpack) is included in your HTML page.
    ```html
    <script src="path/to/your/dist/wysiwyg-markdown-editor.bundle.js"></script>
    ```

2.  **Prepare an HTML element:**
    This element will be transformed into the editor.
    ```html
    <div id="myMarkdownEditor"></div>
    ```

3.  **Initialize the editor:**
    Use the static `init` method of the `MarkdownEditor` class.

    ```javascript
    // Ensure the script is loaded, e.g., by placing your script after the bundle or using DOMContentLoaded
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const editor = MarkdownEditor.init('myMarkdownEditor', {
        // Optional: future options can be passed here
        // e.g., { theme: 'dark', customToolbar: [...] }
      });
    });
    ```

## Usage Guide

### Editing Experience

*   **Enter Key:** Pressing `Enter` creates a new paragraph with automatic directionality (`dir="auto"`).
*   **Backspace Key:**
    *   At the beginning of a formatted block (like a heading or list item), `Backspace` will convert that block back to its plain Markdown representation.
    *   Otherwise, `Backspace` behaves as expected for text deletion.
*   **Automatic Formatting:** As you type Markdown syntax for block elements (e.g., `# `, `* `, `> `), the editor will typically auto-format it into the corresponding HTML style.

### Supported Markdown Syntax

The editor supports a comprehensive range of standard Markdown syntax:

*   **Headers:**
    *   `# Heading 1`
    *   `## Heading 2`
    *   `### Heading 3`
    *   `#### Heading 4`
    *   `##### Heading 5`
    *   `###### Heading 6`
*   **Text Formatting (Inline):**
    *   `**bold text**` (renders as **bold text**)
    *   `*italic text*` or `_italic text_` (renders as *italic text*)
    *   `` `inline code` `` (renders as `inline code`)
*   **Lists:**
    *   Unordered: Start a line with `- ` or `* ` (e.g., `- item`)
    *   Ordered: Start a line with `1. ` (e.g., `1. item`)
*   **Blockquotes:**
    *   `> quote text`
*   **Links:**
    *   `[link text](https://example.com)`
*   **Images:**
    *   `![alt text](image_url.png)`
*   **Horizontal Line (Rule):**
    *   `---` or `***`

**Note on LTR/RTL Support:** All block-level elements like paragraphs, headers, lists, and blockquotes automatically adjust their directionality based on the content, ensuring a natural reading and writing experience for both Left-to-Right and Right-to-Left languages.
